The total numbers of new businesses (in the same category - 'mobile caterers') entered in the system by local authorities in 2016, 2017 and 2018 (to date)?5. If possible, what was the common reason applicants failed inspection?In the LAEMS doc, these are broken down on p74-p77 differently to the rating website for example home caterers in the LAEMS docs comes under 'Restaurants and caterers - Other' however i have spoken to Michael Harding in the FSA rating team and he confirmed on the rating website this falls under the business type 'other catering services'.Can you provide this information in an excel format detailing business name, address, rating number and last inspection carried out so I can sort and filter. I understand you can download some sort of data from the FSA website ( http://ratings.food.gov.uk/open-data/en-GB ) but this doesn't work and also your website is confusing but i appreciate this is because FSA is in the process of updating its website. I appreciate that it is the responsibility of the local authorities to input the information into the system however the FSA as i would expect have the data of the London boroughs available on the system to pull out.

In March 2018, the Scottish Government admitted via a Parliamentary Reply from the Cabinet Secretary for the Environment, Climate Change and Land Reform that SEPA ""does not currently monitor for microplastics but is engaged with academic researchers looking into improving understanding of this problem"" and that ""Marine Scotland monitors microplastics in the water column, in sub-tidal marine sediment and also on the sea surface which can wash onto beaches"".  49)  In Norway, Naturvernforbundet (Friends of the Earth Norway) estimate a potential of 325 tonnes of microplastic from Norwegian fish farms a year leading to calls for a ban on plastic pipes on salmon farms.

Annex 18 clearly relates to working instructions on how to handle such claims.
