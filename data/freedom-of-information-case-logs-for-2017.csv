I wish to request details of all monthly records of non-compliance (and the enforcement action taken) by Official Veterinarians, as reported on the FSA's Animal Welfare Database, for between April 2014 - March 2016.I am aware that this information has already been released in a previous FOI request. However, the names and locations of the slaughterhouses concerned were withheld.For the purpose of our analysis, I would like to request that the slaughterhouse names be anonymised using what the ICO calls deterministic modification. In other words each slaughterhouse could be given a code eg A1 and by using a simple control and replace function all instances of that slaughterhouse appearing on the database could be anonymised.This would take no more than ten seconds per slaughterhouse and as there are around 250 of them it should take no longer than 40 minutes per year or 2 hours for the entire 3 years that we've requested. This is well within the statutory 20 hour period.I would also like to request that you disclose the county in which the slaughterhouse is located. As there are multiple slaughterhouses in each county there is no risk of the individual slaughterhouse being identified."

2145,2017-12-05,Ops Assurance,What do they know,All provided,n/a,2018-01-08,20,"Please accept this email as a new FoI Act 2000 request.Q1. How many slaughter houses are there in England.Q2. How many slaughter houses are authorised to kill animals without pre-stunning them ?Q3. Ref: https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/700407/Halal-Kosher-Muslim-Jewish-abattoir-slaughterhouse-British-Vet-Food-Standard-Agency""MUSLIM and Jewish slaughterhouses must now publish the number of animals they kill without stunning first after leading vets demanded more transparency."" That press statement from the Daily Express dated the 16 August 2016 contradicts your assertion that, ""the FSA doesn?t collect data on which slaughterhouses produce halal meat"". It is not the production of halal meat per say, it?s the method of killing the animal.My Question 3 is, do you contradict the Chair of the FSA Mrs Heather Hancock who is quoted as saying, ""the new survey would show how many slaughterhouses were stunning or not stunning and this routine data will be regularly supplemented with additional information on the numbers of animals that are slaughtered by these methods? ?Q4. Is the President of the BVA (Mr Sean Wensley) wrong when he says, ?This announcement is a welcome step in the right direction, with public recognition of the need to have reliable and routine data on the number of non-stunned and stunned animals. ?Q5. Given that the President of the BVA said, ""The exemption in legislation that allows for non-stun slaughter is to provide food for certain religious communities. There should only be a quantity of non-stun slaughter that allows for that, and that alone. A significant proportion of sheep and goat meat in particular from non-stun slaughter is going outside the communities for which it is intended, which is contrary to the legislation.?Thus my Q5 is: What steps are being taken by the FSA to make absolutely clear HMG's legislation is being correctly followed to only allow a sufficient quantity of animals killed to satisfy the needs of the Halal fraternity and that alone ? I feel particularly offended at NOT knowing if the meat I buy has been killed humanely or not. Q6. When are you going to insist labelling of meat differentiates the killing method ?Q7. How many slaughter houses are named/known as ""Muslim"" and how many are named/known as ""Jewish"" as there appears to be a ready distinction in the eyes of the Press and the BVA ?Q8. Given that HMG wants CCTV in all slaughter houses by ""next spring"" what steps are being taken by the FSA to monitor that requirement ?Q9. The FSA Chair Heather Hancock delivered a lecture (CAMPDEN BRI LECTURE - updated 16 Jun 17) in which she said , ""Trust arrives on foot. It leaves on horseback.""  She also said, ""The uncomfortable truth is that your average person has very little knowledge of the journey their food has taken, before it got to their kitchen or their plate. That lack of comprehension breeds unease and distrust."" My Question 9 is: How is the FSA apparently ignorant of how many animals are being slaughtered by the non-stunning method which goes against the grain of our Christian society ?Q9 (a)  How is the FSA going to alleviate my incomprehension of the black-hole in the data mountain on this subject ?Q10. The Chair of the FSA said, ""To trust their food they have to trust you. They have to trust me and the FSA. And, industry and regulator, we have to improve our trust in each other.""My Question 10 is: What data is being prepared and when will it show me the meat I buy is sourced from a British slaughter house which obeys the Christian rules of stunning the animal before it is killed ?Q11. ""First, we always need half an eye on the next food crisis"" - once again, Mrs Hancock. What is the FSA doing to ensure the British public are aware that eating meat vaccinated against the FMDv is perfectly safe to eat ?""Half an eye"" will just not do ! "

Are any animals stunned before they are killed in a halal abattoir? If so, what proportion of the total? Who checks to see if the stunning is sufficient to make the animal unconscious before it is killed?
